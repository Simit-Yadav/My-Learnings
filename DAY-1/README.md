# Time Complexity 

The best programmer are those who come up with algorithms having  
best time and space complexity.  
  
Time efficiency is very crucial when we are working with big data set. We have three ways to measure the time complexity of a program:  
> - Using a timer - not to use unefficient.
> - Counting every operation in program. - no
> - using abstract notation of order of growth (O(n)).
  
## Big O Notation
  
Big O is a notation for measuring the complexity of an algorithm. Big O notation mathematically describes the complexity of an algorithm in terms of time and space. O is short for “Order of growth.”.  

**The use of O(n) is basically to measure worst case scenario. Thats how it works.**

### There are many types of orders of growth in ascending order: 
1. &nbsp;constant time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(1) best complexity.
1. &nbsp;Linear time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(n)
1. &nbsp;Logarithmic time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(log n)
1. &nbsp;Loglinear time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(nlog n)
1. &nbsp;Polynomical time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(n^c) it includes quadratic, cubic, etc.
1. &nbsp;Exponential time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(c^n)
1. &nbsp;Factorial time &nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp; O(n!) worst case.
  
**We should always try to be in top 23 in the above table.**  

**Best design practices include a program to be efficient, organised, commented and considering worstcase scenario.**
