## Course - 2 The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking.

### <b>Week - 1</b>
<b>Introduction to Networking</b>  
In this week we got to know about network devices like Hub, Routers, Switch. Along with that, we learnt about the TCP/IP model which is a used in computer networking. Throughout the week we had brief discussion on Network, Internet, TCP/IP Model, UDP, 7 Layer networking model called OSI(Open Systems Interconnection), cables, ways of communication simplex,duplex, full duplex, MAC address, Unicasting, RJ45, Network port, Patch Panels. We also learnt about data-packet and how its works when sent as a Ethernet frame.

### <b>Week - 2</b>
<b>Network Layer</b>  
In this week, a lot of the information was covered about the Network Layer. First of all, we started by knowing what are the responsibilities of the network layer, devices used at network layer, protocols used at network layer, subnetting, and finally routing and its protocols. We learnt what a IP header Datagram header contains and how they are formed. We learnt few protocols used at network layer are ARP, DHCP, Routing Protocols, CIDR, and also learnt about how routers communicate with each other to calcuate the shortes route for the traffic with Border Gateeay Protocol(BGP).

### <b>Week - 3</b>
<b>Transport and Application Layer</b>  
The week was well covered with the topics of Transport and Application layer and their protocols. The transport layer uses TCP/UDP protocol. TCP is a 5 layer model and UDP is a 7 layer model. The two additional layer in UDP are session and presentation. We show how a TCP header is made and what fields are set in it. Along with it, we leaarnt about the three-way handshake which is done in the beginning between two computers to share data. We also show different control flags in the TCP header which tells us many things about the TCP payload. We also studied about PORTS in computers including system port, registered port and private or ephemeral port. We also how how the TCP model work in all-unison. Explanation found in notes.

### <b>Week - 4</b>  
<b>Introduction to network services</b>  
In this week we learnt about what are the main things to see whenever facing a network issue. They are  
1. IP address
1. Subnet Mask
1. Gateway
1. Name Server  

Name servers works in different hierarchical see more in notes. Handle the four necessary parts for each computer on a network is very difficult so to overcome the problem we introduced dynamic host configuration protocol(DHCP). It a technology which has reserved IP address, basically hands our IPv6 addresses, and which also keep track of IP address ever connected to the DHCP server. It has few type of allocation like fixed, static, dynamic and automatic. Though making widespread adoption of IPv6 will take a lot of time and before it companies ran out of IPv4 addresses. To tackle the situation technology called Network Address Transmission(NAT) was introduced. It is also more of a security feature which helps to protect IP address of a node on a network from another node. To do this it uses a technique called Port Forwarding. Access a local network important files through internet will be risky so perform the task in a better way Virtual Private Network(VPN) were introduced. It helps to connect to our local network anywhere from world. It makes end to end connection to our work network. Proxies are a type of filtering, securing system.
