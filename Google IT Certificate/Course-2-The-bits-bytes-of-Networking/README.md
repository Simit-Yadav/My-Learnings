## Course - 2 The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking.

### <b>Week - 1</b>
<b>Introduction to Networking</b>  
In this week we got to know about network devices like Hub, Routers, Switch. Along with that, we learnt about the TCP/IP model which is a used in computer networking. Throughout the week we had brief discussion on Network, Internet, TCP/IP Model, UDP, 7 Layer networking model called OSI(Open Systems Interconnection), cables, ways of communication simplex,duplex, full duplex, MAC address, Unicasting, RJ45, Network port, Patch Panels. We also learnt about data-packet and how its works when sent as a Ethernet frame.

### <b>Week - 2</b>
In this week, a lot of the information was covered about the Network Layer. First of all, we started by knowing what are the responsibilities of the network layer, devices used at network layer, protocols used at network layer, subnetting, and finally routing and its protocols. We learnt what a IP header Datagram header contains and how they are formed. We learnt few protocols used at network layer are ARP, DHCP, Routing Protocols, CIDR, and also learnt about how routers communicate with each other to calcuate the shortes route for the traffic with Border Gateeay Protocol(BGP).
