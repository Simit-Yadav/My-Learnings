# Start of Google IT Support Certificate on Coursera.  

## Course 1 Technical Support Fundamentals.
### <b>Week - 01</b>  

### <b>IT (Information Technology)  </b>

The use of digital technology like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information. 

### <b>What does IT support specialist do ?</b>
They make sure an organization technical equipments are working properly. I.E. Managing, Installing, Maintaining, Troubleshooting, Configuring. 

### <b>Computers</b>
The communication that a computer uses is know as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system.

### <b>Binary system</b>
Bit, bytes, standard length of byte 8 bits. We get 2^8 values which is 256. Max Values 255. In one byte we can store 1 character. 

### Logic Gates
It is like ON and OFF. There are many logic gates which have a specific conditions to conduct electricity and return outputs. Like AND, OR, NOT, NOR.

### <b>Character Encoding</b>
Assigns our binary values to characters, so we as humans can read them. Eg. ACSII, UTF-8.


### <b>Abstraction</b>
To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use. 

### <b>Computer and its architecture.</b>
Basically four layers of computer architecture:   
1. Hardware
1. OS (Operating system)
1. Software
1. User

### <b>Week - 02</b>  

### <b>Ports</b>
Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of a computer.

### <b>Hardware components</b>
CPU(Central Processing Unit), RAM(Random Access Memory), Hard Drive, Motherboard, Power supply.

### <b>Programs</b>
Instructions that tell the computer what to do.

### <b>EDB - External Data Bus</b>
It helps us to move our data from one compunent to another. It's nothing but group of wires which transmit 1s and 0s like follows if 1 pass current and if 0 don't pass current. It comes in many sizes 8, 16, 32, 64 bits.  

If EDB is of size 8 it means it has 8 wires which can carry 8 bits of data or 1 byte of data in one time.  

### <b>Registers</b>
Registers are components present inside CPU. It allows us to store data which our CPU works with. 

### <b>MCC - Memory Controller Chip </b>
MCC is the bridge between the CPU and RAM. 

### <b>Address Bus</b>
Address Bus connects the CPU to the MCC. It sends over the location of the data and than MCC looks for the location for the data and send it to CPU. 

### <B>Cache</b>
It is faster than RAM are stores recently or frequently used data for faster access.  
  
Cache has three different levels:  
1. L1 - smallest and fastest cache.
1. L2
1. L3

### <b>CPU</b>
Brain of our computer which performs all the calcualtions. It has a instruction book which it follows to perform operations. It has predefined instructions for addition, subtraction etc. 
Every line goes into CPU is first boken down into separate instructions.  
  
We just cannot take any component and assume it will work.  
  
To connect our CPU to a mother board we need a compatible motherboard. CPU is connected to motherboard throught a socket.  
  
Currently there are two type of socket: 
1. Land Grid Array (LGA)
1. Pin Grid Array (PGA)
  
Mainly we need a heat sink to cool down heat from our CPU and exit it with a fan.  

### <b>RAM</b>
Lots of types of RAM are found in Computers Commonly found RAM is DRAM.(Dynamic RAM). Stores 1s and 0s in a capacitor found in DRAM. Capacitor is either charged or discharged.  
  
Memory Stick - DIMM
DDR SDRAM- Double data rate SDRAM.
