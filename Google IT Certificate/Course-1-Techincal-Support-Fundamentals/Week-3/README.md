### <b>Remote Connection</b>
Allows us to manage multiple machines from anywhere in the world. We can connect to a remote connection with SSH, VPN.

### <b>Secure Shell (SSH)</b>
A protocol implemented by other programs to securly access one computer from another.

### <b>Virtual Private Netowork (VPN)</b>
Allows us to connect to a private network, like your work network, over the internet.

### <b>Operating Systems</b>
The whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it.

They have a kernel which does these tasks:  
1. File Management
1. Process Management
1. Memory Management
1. I/O Management.

First the BIOS/UEFI checks and initialize the hardware on our computer when all set it search for the bootloader from either hard disk, pendrive, or CD(we can also select it manually). Once the bootloader is found it runs some test than run the OS. After that the OS runs the drivers to work with other components.

### <b>Virtual Memory</b>
It is the combination of RAM and Hard disk space which is used by kernel to load pages to RAM. Pages are basically cunks of a big program.

### <b>Shell</b>
A program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.

### <b>Installing process</b>
Windows can be install from a pendrive bought from the store. Ubuntu iso image can be downloaded to a pendrive and before copying the iso image we have to make the drive bootable with tools like etcher.io etc. Chrome OS and MAC OS come pre-installed in the machine.  
  
We have to also make sure to see if the components we have is compatible with the CPU, OS. Like if we have a 32bit CPU architecture than we should have a 32bit OS.
