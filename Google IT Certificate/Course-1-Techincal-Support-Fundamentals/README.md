<b>Operating Systems(OS)</b>  
The week-3 was so interesting as we learnt about how the components we installed works through a software called OS. OS manages our computer for us by giving us the userspace to handle it. We learnt about kernel which is the very main part of our OS. Kernel manages a lot of things for us like process management, memory management, I/O management and file management. Along the week, we learnt about many different OS like Windows, MAC OS, Chrome OS a web bases OS and Linux and how to install in our machine. We practiced on a platform called Qwicklab.

### <b>Week - 04</b>
<b>Networking</b>  
In this week we learnt about network and how they are made. In IT managing, designing and building network is known as networking. Take the lesson forward we learnt about how are computers communicate and how they are connected to internet. The basic thing which everybody gets confused in is Internet and WWW(world wide web). Internet is made by physically connecting computers and wires around world. Web allows us to access the Internet. Our clients don't directly connect to internet instead they connect to the ISP(Internet Service Provider). Routers are the networking hardware which manage the traffic and connect devices on the same network. Some other network devices are hub and switch. We also learnt few things about security.
