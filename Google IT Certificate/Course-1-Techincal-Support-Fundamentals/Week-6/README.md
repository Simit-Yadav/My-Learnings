<b>Sympathy vs Empathy</b>  

Sympathy is when we share someone's feeling.  
Empathy is seeing something from someone else perspective to understand the feelings.

### <b>Documentation in IT</b>
We write documentation we have already countered either in some ticketing system, bug system or anywhere our colleague can access it in our organisation.  
  
While writing the documentation be concise, write issue, what made issue to occur and steps you took to solve the issue.
