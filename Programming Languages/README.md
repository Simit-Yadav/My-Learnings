# Concepts same for all languages

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The fundamenal concepts of a object-oriented languages are as follows:  
1. Polymorphism
1. Inheritance
1. Encapsulation
1. Abstraction

## Inheritance
Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.

## Encapsulation
In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.


## Recursion
Recursion is a technique of solving problem by a function, calling itself.
